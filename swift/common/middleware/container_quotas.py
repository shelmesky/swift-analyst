The ``container_quotas`` middleware implements simple quotas that can be
imposed on swift containers by a user with the ability to set container
metadata, most likely the account administrator.  This can be useful for
limiting the scope of containers that are delegated to non-admin users, exposed
to ``formpost`` uploads, or just as a self-imposed sanity check.

Any object PUT operations that exceed these quotas return a 413 response
(request entity too large) with a descriptive body.

Quotas are subject to several limitations: eventual consistency, the timeliness
of the cached container_info (60 second ttl by default), and it's unable to
reject chunked transfer uploads that exceed the quota (though once the quota
is exceeded, new chunked transfers will be refused).

Quotas are set by adding meta values to the container, and are validated when
set:

+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|Metadata                                     | Use                           |
+=============================================+===============================+
| X-Container-Meta-Quota-Bytes                | Maximum size of the           |
|                                             | container, in bytes.          |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| X-Container-Meta-Quota-Count                | Maximum object count of the   |
|                                             | container.                    |
